# Image-Outline-with-Texture
This application enables users to choose an image and a texture to produce a visually striking outline effect. Utilizing OpenCV for robust image processing, the program employs Tkinter to provide a simple and intuitive interface for image selection. The outline is created through Canny edge detection, which is then blended with the chosen texture to add depth and character to the final output.
# Features
* Select any main image and texture image via a file dialog.
* Generate outlines from the selected image.
* Blend the outlines with the texture image.
* Display results using Matplotlib.
# Requirements
* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (opencv-python)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Tkinter (included with Python)
