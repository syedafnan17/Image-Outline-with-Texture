# Image-Outline-with-Texture
This project allows users to select any image and a texture image to create an artistic outline effect. The application uses OpenCV for image processing and Tkinter for a user-friendly interface to select images. The outline is generated using Canny edge detection and is blended with a texture to enhance the visual appeal.
